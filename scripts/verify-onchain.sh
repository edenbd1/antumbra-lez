# Re-check a v0.3 run of antumbra_vesting against a LEZ v0.3 sequencer, from a

#
# A manifest is what scripts/e2e-v03.sh writes: one line per transaction
#   label  expected(applied|refused)  verdict  block  tx
# and comment lines, of which three kinds are checked:
#   # program <header>  <image-id-hex>        the header's program_loader shard names this ImageID
#   # final   <account> <shard-program> <sha256-of-shard-bytes>
#   # check ok: ...                            (informational; counted, not re-run)
#
# What is checked, and what a v0.3 chain lets one check:
# - applied and reverted transactions are both included in a block, and must be
#   found in the block the manifest names. On v0.3 a refused public transaction
#   is included and charged; what makes it a refusal is that it changed nothing,
#   which the final-state lines below pin down.
# - rejected and never-included transactions must not resolve.
# - every `final` line: the account's shard hashes to the recorded value now.
#   Schedules and escrows are PDAs only this program can change, so their final
#   state is stable once a run ends.
# - a random hash must not resolve, or the endpoint is answering anything.
#
# Needs curl and python3. Exits non-zero on any mismatch.
